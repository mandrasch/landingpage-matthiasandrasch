**Green Coding and Sustainable Software**

Definition Green Coding:

> Green Coding is the act of designing, developing, maintaining, and (re-)using
> software systems in a way that requires as little energy and natural resources as possible. Green Coding methods or practices thus mean any action or
> use of technology intended and suitable to further this. (Junger et al., 2024)

Definition Sustainable Software:

> Sustainable software is software that minimizes environmental impact and
> maximizes resource efficiency in its design, development, operation and use
> while considering economic and social factors. (Calero et al., 2021).
