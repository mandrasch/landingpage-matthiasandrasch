# Good to have you here!

Hi, my name is Matthias. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a web developer, working with tools like <a href="/projects#craftcms">Craft CMS</a>, <a href="/projects#sveltekit">Svelte(Kit)</a> and <a href="/projects#ddev">DDEV</a>.

Next to that I'm interested in topics such as <a href="/green-coding">Green Web</a> and <a href="/climate-justice">Climate Justice</a>.<!--  I do wonder about the <a href="/absurdity-of-life">absurdity of our existence on this planet</a>. I also maintain a few <a href="/writing">blogs</a> in my leisure time. -->
